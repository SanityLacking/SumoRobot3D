SumoRobot3D


This Project uses the ML-Agents Plugin Library from Unity to connect and train Neural Networks for use in the simulation. To install this plugin, follow the instructions found at: [ML-Agents Docs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md).
The TL:DR of these instructions are: 
1. Download the ML-Agents Repo and add it to the assets folder of your unity project. 
2. In your preferred Python environment, install the python api package by running: 
```python
pip install ml-agents
```


## Training a neural network using ML-Agents: 

Follow the directions [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Create-New.md) from instruction `Implement an Academy` to setup your project to be ready to train and run the nerual network. This project should be setup to go, however it is a good idead to check the instructions to make sure everything is configured correctly.
